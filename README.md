# landing-page-project

4/22/2022
This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum. By this point in my journey, I have learned basic HTML and CSS. As a result,
I am going to be creating a basic webpage that will look nice and sleek. It will not have any backend functionality, but is rather
for me to practice frontend development. In upcoming projects, I will be tackling more backend projects.

I do not own any of the youtube videos that are linked. They are all seperate entities, and are not associated with this project.

I own none of the photos on this website. All photos were found on Pexels.com. In order from top to bottom, left to right, the 
photo credits are:
