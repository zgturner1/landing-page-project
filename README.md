# landing-page-project

4/22/2022
This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum. By this point in my journey, I have learned basic HTML and CSS. As a result,
I am going to be creating a basic webpage that will look nice and sleek. It will not have any backend functionality, but is rather
for me to practice frontend development. In upcoming projects, I will be tackling more backend projects.
